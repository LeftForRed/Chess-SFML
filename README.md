# **Two player chess made with C++ and SFML(2D Graphics).**


You need to have SFML installed to compile.
https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/

I have not tried it on Windows yet.

Linux GCC :

    1) g++ -c main.cpp board.cpp piece.cpp pieceTextures.cpp chessGame.cpp
    2) g++ main.o board.o piece.o pieceTextures.o chessGame.o -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
    3) ./a.out
